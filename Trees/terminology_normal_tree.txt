Root--> The parent of the whole tree

Edges are the connection from the parent to the children 
if there are N ROOTS there are N-1 EDGES

Tree is a collection of Nodes 

One of them is the Root Node 

The top one in the Tree is a th Root 

Siblings are the children of the same parent or I should say
the elements which generate from the same parent are called Siblings 

Descendents are all the children which are reachable from the 
Node are called Descendants 

Ancestors are the all the parents which are reachable 
from a child 

Degree of a Node is the number of Children a Node has 

One Important QUESTION IS THAT WHAT IS THE DEGREE OF A TREE
DEGREE OF A TREE IS A MINIMUM OF 3 OR ABOVE 

Terminal Nodes or Leaf Nodes-->
Nodes which have a degree 0 or a Node which has no children are called
a Terminal Node or Leaf Node 

External Nodes/ Non-Leaf Nodes/Non-Terminal Nodes-->
Extrenal Nodes/ Non-leaf Nodes are those nodes which have children and a degree which is more than 0

levels of Tree->>
how many generations a Tree has IT STARTS FROM 0

Height of a TREE-->
in height we count the edges so it starts from 1 cause the ROOT DOESNT HAVE AN EDGES
