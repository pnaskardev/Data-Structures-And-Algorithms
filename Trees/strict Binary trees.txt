General Binary trees can have 0,1,2 children

but a strict Binary tree can only have either 0 children or 2 children and this applies to each and every Node present in the tree

<----------Height vs Nodes------------------->

when Height is given as h
min.Nodes=2(h)+1
max Nodes= 2^(h+1)-1


If Nodes are given 
max.height=(n-1)/2
min.height=log2(n+1)-1

<---------External Nodes/non-teraminal/non leaf Nodes vs Internal Nodes/leaf Nodes/terminal Nodes------------>
e=i+1 this formula is very important
